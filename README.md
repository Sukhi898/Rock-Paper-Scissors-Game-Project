### Problem Statement

The challenge was to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game and make it look as close to the design as possible.

### Features

1. **Two-Player Game**: The game is designed for two players, the human player, and the computer opponent.
2. **Simultaneous Turns**: Both the human player and the computer opponent take their turns simultaneously.
3. **Score Display**: The scores of both players (human and computer) are displayed on the screen.
4. **Outcome Messages**: Different messages are displayed on the screen based on the outcome of the game (win, lose, or tie).
5. **Rules Section**: There is a rules section at the bottom right, clicking on which opens a pop-up displaying the basic rules of the game. There is also a close button to close the pop-up.
6. **Local Storage**: Scores are stored in local storage to prevent loss upon reloading the page.
7. **Celebration Animation**: A celebration animation is displayed if the human player wins against the computer opponent.
